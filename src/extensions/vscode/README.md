# Celerity for Visual Studio Code

**Warning:** This is currently in-development vaporware.

This extension adds support for the
[Celerity programming language](https://docs.vezel.dev/celerity) to
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Features include syntax and
semantic highlighting, code snippets, code navigation, code completion, linting,
document formatting, debugging, testing, and more.

This extension can provide basic language features on its own, but the majority
of functionality requires the Celerity language server. To use the language
server, you must have the `celerity` executable available in your `PATH`, or
configure it manually with the `celerity.path` setting. See Celerity's
[installation instructions](https://docs.vezel.dev/celerity/installation) for
more information.
