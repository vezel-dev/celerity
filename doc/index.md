**Celerity** is a programming language aiming for a good balance of
productivity and scalability while being easily embeddable in host applications.

**Celerity** is expression-oriented, multi-paradigm, and features optional type
checking. Some notable features are pattern matching, first-class functions with
closures, opt-in mutability, explicit yet terse error propagation, concurrency
based on lightweight agents, and non-suspending garbage collection.
