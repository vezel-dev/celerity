**Warning:** This is currently in-development vaporware.

**Celerity** is a programming language aiming for a good balance of
productivity and scalability while being easily embeddable in host applications.

**Celerity** is gradually typed, expression-oriented, and multi-paradigm. Some
notable features are pattern matching, first-class functions with closures,
opt-in mutability, explicit error propagation, concurrency based on lightweight
agents, and non-suspending garbage collection.
