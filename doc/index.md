**Warning:** This is currently in-development vaporware.

**Celerity** is a programming language aiming for a good balance of
productivity and scalability while being easily embeddable in host applications.

**Celerity** is expression-oriented, multi-paradigm, and features optional type
checking through success typings. Some notable features are pattern matching,
first-class functions with closures, opt-in mutability, explicit exception
propagation, concurrency based on lightweight agents, and non-suspending garbage
collection.
