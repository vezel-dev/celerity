# Security

Please do not report vulnerabilities through the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/vezel-dev/celerity/issues); instead, use the
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/vezel-dev/celerity/security/advisories/new)
feature.

Once the vulnerability has been confirmed and a fix implemented, a new release
will be published. This will usually be a patch-level release unless a more
significant major/minor-level release coincides with the fix.
